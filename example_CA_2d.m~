%L is the total # of neurons.
%LL is the size of a side of the 2-dim grid.
%For example, with LL=27, and L=27^2=729, we'll eventually
%create a 25-by-25 grid, and drop the outer boundary.
L=144; LL=12;

%Main parameters.
%p = probability of a rewiring a neighborly connection and making it a long
%distance connection.  When p=0, the network is neighbor-to-neighbor.  When
%p=1, the network is randomly connected.
